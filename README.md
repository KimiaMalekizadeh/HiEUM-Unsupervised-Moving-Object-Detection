# HiEUM: Unsupervised Moving Object Detection (Re-implementation)

This repository contains an educational and qualitative re-implementation of the paper:

**Highly Efficient and Unsupervised Framework for Moving Object Detection in Satellite Videos**  
Chao Xiao et al., IEEE TPAMI.

## Overview
This project reproduces the main algorithmic pipeline of the HiEUM framework, including:
- Dataset reduction for hardware-limited environments
- Background modeling and motion extraction
- Initial sparse representation
- Pseudo-label generation and refinement
- Iterative self-evolution and sparse feedback
- Final moving object detection

The implementation focuses on qualitative analysis and algorithmic understanding rather than quantitative benchmarking.
